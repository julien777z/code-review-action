# Code Review Action

A GitHub Action that reviews pull requests with **Claude** or **Cursor** and posts severity-rated
**inline comments** plus an **Approval Verdict** check run. It reviews only the lines a PR changes,
caps nitpicks, and reconciles its own threads across pushes.

## Quick start

Add a workflow to your repo:

```yaml
name: Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, ready_for_review]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
  checks: write

jobs:
  review:
    name: Review
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    concurrency:
      group: code-review-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number }}-${{ github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && 'comment' || 'review' }}
      cancel-in-progress: true
    steps:
      - uses: julien777z/code-review-action@v0
        with:
          cursor-api-key: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
```

Provide at least one backend credential (`anthropic-api-key` or `cursor-api-key`). Comment
`agent review` on a PR to trigger a manual review.

## Examples

Each snippet is the `with:` block for the step in the Quick start workflow — swap it in.

Use Claude instead of Cursor:

```yaml
with:
  anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

Claude on the first review, Cursor on later pushes:

```yaml
with:
  anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
  cursor-api-key: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
  first-review-model: claude
  review-model: cursor
```

Comment only, scoped to source files:

```yaml
with:
  cursor-api-key: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
  approval-disable: "true"
  include-paths: "src/**"
  exclude-paths: "**/*.lock"
```

Request changes only on critical or high findings:

```yaml
with:
  cursor-api-key: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
  approval-include: "critical, high"
```

## Choosing the model

- `review-model` — `auto` (default), `claude`, or `cursor`. `auto` prefers Claude when an Anthropic
  key is set, otherwise uses Cursor.
- `first-review-model` — optional backend used for the PR's first review (opened / ready for review).
  When empty, `review-model` is used for every event. Example: `first-review-model: claude` with
  `review-model: cursor` reviews the opened PR with Claude and later pushes with Cursor.

## PR description summary

On the first review of a PR (opened or marked ready for review), the action appends an AI-generated
summary — a short bullet list of the change, a risk note, and an overview — to the PR description.
Whatever the author wrote stays at the top; the summary is added below it, between hidden markers so a
later review replaces the section in place instead of stacking a second one. It runs only on those
first-review events, never on later pushes.

- `pr-review-summary` — set to `false` to turn the summary off (default `true`).

## Enforcing project rules

With `enforce-project-rules` on (the default), the review applies your repository's own coding rules
and reports a finding on any changed line that violates them. Both backends load those rules by
cloning the repository during the review, so they pick up whatever rule files the agent understands
(for example `.cursor/rules` or `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/rules`) automatically.

**Cursor backend.** Cursor clones the repository through its own GitHub App, which must have access to
the repository. In GitHub, go to **Settings → Applications → Cursor** and make sure its **Repository
access** includes this repo (**All repositories**, or **Only select repositories** with it selected).
If Cursor cannot reach the repo, the review fails with a message telling you to check the Cursor GitHub
App (or to set `enforce-project-rules: false`).

**Claude backend.** Claude reviews through a [Managed
Agents](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents) session that mounts the repository at the
PR's head commit, so Claude Code loads `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/rules` natively. The repository is cloned
with the run's `github-token` (which needs `contents: read`), so no extra GitHub connection is required.
The action creates a cloud environment for each run and deletes it afterward; to reuse a pre-provisioned
environment instead, set `claude-environment-id`. When `enforce-project-rules` is `false`, the session
runs without the repository mounted and reviews from the diff alone.

- `enforce-project-rules` — set to `false` to review without cloning the repo, skipping rule
  enforcement (default `true`).
- `claude-environment-id` — Managed Agents cloud environment id the Claude backend reuses instead of
  creating a fresh one per run. Empty creates and deletes one each run (default empty).

## Suggesting simplifications

Off by default, the review can also suggest code simplifications as low-severity nits (optional
suggestions that never block).

- `simplify-suggest` — apply the agent's `code-simplify` skill to the changed code and suggest
  simplifications (default `false`).
- `simplify-nearby-code` — extend those suggestions to weigh the nearby and related code the change
  touches, not just the changed lines in isolation (default `false`). Findings still anchor on changed
  lines.

## Approval behaviour

- `approval-include` — severities that request changes when left open (default `critical`). Other
  open findings post as a comment; zero open findings approves.
- `approval-disable` — post comments only and skip the verdict and check run.

## Resolving the action's own threads

As the PR evolves the action resolves the review threads whose findings no longer apply. The default
`GITHUB_TOKEN` **cannot** resolve review threads — GitHub rejects `resolveReviewThread` with "Resource
not accessible by integration" — so by default stale threads stay open even though the verdict count is
correct.

To enable auto-resolution, give the action a token with pull-request write via `resolve-token`. It is
used **only** to resolve threads, so review comments stay authored by `github-actions[bot]`.

A **GitHub App** is the best fit across several repos: create it once, install it on each repo, and the
same workflow snippet below mints a per-repo token automatically. The minted token is short-lived — it
expires after an hour and is revoked when the job ends — so nothing long-lived is stored. The App is
yours and lives in your account; no server to run.

1. Create a GitHub App (**Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**). Under
   **Permissions → Repository → Pull requests** select **Read and write**; leave everything else off.
2. **Install** the App on every repository whose threads it should resolve.
3. On the App's settings page, note its **Client ID** and **Generate a private key** (downloads a `.pem`).
4. Expose the credentials to those repos' workflows:
   - **Organization repos:** add an organization **variable** `CODE_REVIEW_APP_CLIENT_ID` and
     organization **secret** `CODE_REVIEW_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` once, scoped to the repos that use the action.
   - **Personal repos:** add the same **variable** and **secret** to each repo (personal accounts have no
     secrets shared across repos).
5. Mint a token in the workflow and pass it to `resolve-token`:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v3
    id: app-token
    with:
      client-id: ${{ vars.CODE_REVIEW_APP_CLIENT_ID }}
      private-key: ${{ secrets.CODE_REVIEW_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }}
  - uses: julien777z/code-review-action@v0
    with:
      cursor-api-key: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
      resolve-token: ${{ steps.app-token.outputs.token }}
```

For a single repository, a fine-grained PAT with **Pull requests: write** stored as the
`CODE_REVIEW_TOKEN` secret also works (`resolve-token: ${{ secrets.CODE_REVIEW_TOKEN }}`), but it is
tied to your account and expires, so the App scales better.

## Restricting who can trigger reviews

Use this to control who can spend review runs — for example, to stop outside or first-time
contributors from kicking off a review on every PR while still letting your team request one.

`author-associations` is an allowlist of GitHub author associations allowed to trigger a review —
both on pull-request events and via the `agent review` comment. Leave it empty (the default) to
allow everyone. Valid values: `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, `COLLABORATOR`, `CONTRIBUTOR`,
`FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIMER`, `MANNEQUIN`, `NONE`.

Allow anyone (the default):

```yaml
with:
  cursor-api-key: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
  author-associations: ""
```

Allow only the repository owner and organization members:

```yaml
with:
  cursor-api-key: ${{ secrets.CURSOR_API_KEY }}
  author-associations: "OWNER, MEMBER"
```
